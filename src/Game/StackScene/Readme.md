 Create 144 sprites (NOT graphics object) that are stack on each other like cards (so object above covers bottom one, but not completely). Every second 1 object from top of stack goes to other stack - animation of moving should be 2 seconds long. So at the end of whole process you should have reversed stack. Display number of fps in left top corner and make sure, that this demo runs well on mobile devices.
